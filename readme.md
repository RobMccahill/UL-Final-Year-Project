# Final Year Project
This project is a navigation system built on the iOS SDK utilizing ARKit and various MapKit frameworks.

The goal is to provide a visual aid through the devices' camera and to utilize ARKits' real-world tracking to refine location accuracy.

At the moment functionality is available for searching and selecting a desired destination and a basic path has been established.

Further progress will require an establishment of this virtual path in relation to the real world and the conversion of latitude-longitude coordinates into physical points in the AR Scene.
